If your build system is prevented from downloading the binaries for the [`kerberos`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos) package by a firewall, you will need to create a mirror of the binaries inside your intranet. However, this package is available for those cases where this is not possible.  
Check out the link below for more details on what issues it solves.

This package is an exact duplicate of the Kerberos package. Additionally, it has embedded the assets included in the Github release.
